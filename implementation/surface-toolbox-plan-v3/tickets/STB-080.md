# STB-080: Feature-flag non-core analytics UI

- Epic: RefocusUX
- Estimate: 2 points
- Dependencies: STB-074

## Scope
Hide slicing, fit-cylinder, and residual analysis panels behind a feature flag while keeping code paths available.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Analytics panels are hidden by default from Surface core workflow.
- Analytics logic remains behind a boolean feature flag for later enablement.
- Build and verification gates pass.
