# BCC-004: Increase Finalize Timeout to Fix Card Disappearing

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Cards still disappear with current 250ms timeout

## Description
The current 250ms timeout (200ms animation + 50ms buffer) is insufficient in some cases, causing cards to still disappear during drag operations. Need to increase to 500ms for more reliability.

## Root Cause
- FLIP animation takes 200ms
- Current 50ms buffer is too small
- Some drag operations trigger multiple state updates
- Browser repaint cycles can be slower on some systems

## Solution
Increase timeout to 500ms (200ms animation + 300ms buffer) to ensure all state updates complete.

## Implementation

### File: `src/lib/components/bushing/BushingSortableLane.svelte`

**Change:**
```typescript
const flipDurationMs = 200;
const ANIMATION_BUFFER_MS = 300; // Increased from 50 to 300

function handleFinalize(ev: CustomEvent<DndEvent<{ id: string }>>) {
  workingItems = ev.detail.items;
  setTimeout(() => {
    isDragging = false;
    dispatch('finalize', { items: ev.detail.items });
  }, flipDurationMs + ANIMATION_BUFFER_MS); // Now 500ms total
}
```

## Testing
1. Test drag operations with Playwright
2. Drag multiple cards in quick succession
3. Verify no disappearing across all scenarios
4. Test on slow devices/browsers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Timeout increased to 500ms
- [ ] No cards disappear during any drag operation
- [ ] Smooth animation still works
- [ ] Tested with Playwright

## Estimated Time
30 minutes
