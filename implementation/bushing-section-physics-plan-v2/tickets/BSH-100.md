# BSH-100 Runtime-path integrity + stale module detector

## Goal
Guarantee that bushing renderer/solver modules resolve correctly and fail loudly if stale paths are loaded.

## Scope
- Add import-path integrity test for bushing drafting stack.
- Add runtime sentinel to detect legacy module mismatch during HMR.

## Files
- `src/lib/drafting/bushing/*`
- `tests/*bushing*`

## Acceptance
- No unresolved import path for scene model/renderer.
- Test fails if stale path is referenced.
