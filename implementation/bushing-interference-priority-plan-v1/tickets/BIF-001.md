# BIF-001

- Status: Todo
- Estimate: 3
- Dependencies: BIF-000
- Target Files:
  - src/lib/core/bushing/types.ts
  - src/lib/core/bushing/solve.ts

## Scope
Represent machining capability constraints for bore process (e.g., reamer-fixed, adjustable-with-floor).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Capability model supports minimum achievable bore tolerance width.
- Solver can query capability limits without UI coupling.
