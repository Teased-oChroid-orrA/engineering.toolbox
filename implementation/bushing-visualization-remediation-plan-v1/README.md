# Bushing Visualization Remediation Plan v1

## Purpose
Fix two blocking quality failures in Bushing Toolbox:
- Low readability/contrast in result cards (`Safety Margins`, `Fit Physics`, `Edge Distance`, `Wall Thickness`).
- Broken `Assembly Visualization` rendering (garbled overlap, scaling/containment failures).

## Deliverables
- `PLAN.md`: gated plan and acceptance criteria.
- `taskboard.md`: implementation-ready ticket board.
- `dag.md`: dependency sequence.
- `tickets/`: issue-sized tickets (`BSH-090..099`).
- `release-readiness.md`: signoff checklist for this remediation.
