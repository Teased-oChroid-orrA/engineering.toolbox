# Bushing Toolbox Plan v1 Pack

## Contents
- `PLAN.md`: gated implementation plan
- `taskboard.md`: sprint-oriented execution board
- `dag.md`: dependency ordering
- `tickets/`: issue-sized ticket specs

## Execution rules
- Use existing dependencies in `package.json` first.
- Add dependencies only with explicit improvement rationale.
- All sketches/figures are D3-driven.
- Keep files/modules within architecture soft limits.
