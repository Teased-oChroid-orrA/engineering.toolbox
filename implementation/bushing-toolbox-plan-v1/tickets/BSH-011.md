# BSH-011

- Status: Todo
- Estimate: 3
- Dependencies: BSH-010
- Target Files:
  - src/lib/core/bushing/normalize.ts
  - src/lib/core/bushing/solve.ts

## Scope
Add normalized adapter for legacy aliases and casing variants.

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement adapter from legacy/raw shape to canonical shape.
2. Move alias handling out of solver core where possible.
3. Keep backward compatibility for persisted forms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Legacy keys still work.
- Solver consumes normalized canonical shape.
