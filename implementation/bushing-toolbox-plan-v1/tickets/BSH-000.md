- Status: Todo
- Estimate: 2
- Dependencies: none
- Target Files:
  - src/lib/bushing/BushingArchitectureManifest.ts

## Scope
Create a Bushing architecture manifest defining module boundaries and LOC soft caps aligned with Surface/Inspector philosophy.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add manifest with modules, ownership, and max LOC.
2. Define allowed dependency directions (route -> orchestrator -> controller/service -> core).
3. Document exceptions and migration policy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Manifest exists and is referenced by verify tooling.
- LOC caps are explicit for major files.
- Dependency direction rules are documented.
