# BSH-001

- Status: Todo
- Estimate: 2
- Dependencies: BSH-000
- Target Files:
  - scripts/verify-bushing-architecture.mjs
  - package.json

## Scope
Add architecture verification for Bushing and wire it into `npm run check`.

## Implementation Steps
1. Implement script to enforce file caps and mandatory module presence.
2. Add script output in same format as existing verify scripts.
3. Wire into package scripts and CI path.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fails when Bushing caps are exceeded.
- Runs on `npm run check`.
- Passes on baseline after decomposition.
